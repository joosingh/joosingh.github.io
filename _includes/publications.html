<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising privacy-preserving solution, which facilitates collaborative learning. However, FL is also vulnerable to poisoning attacks, as it has no control over the participantâ€™s behavior. Machine learning (ML) models are heavily trained for low generalization errors. Generative models learn the patterns in the input data to discover out-of-distribution samples, which can be used to poison the model, thereby degrading its performance. This paper proposes a novel approach to generate poisoned (adversarial) samples using hyperdimensional computing (HDC), projecting an input sample to a large HD space and perturbing it in the vicinity of the target class HDC model. This perturbation preserves the semantics of the original samples and adds hidden backdoor/noise into it. It generates a large set of adversarial samples equal to the HD space.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Deep neural networks (DNNs) have revolutionized machine learning with their remarkable capabilities in various applications. However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, where subtle perturbations can lead to misclassification, raises significant concerns regarding their reliability and security. In this paper, we study adversarial attacks by implementing a sophisticated patch-based methodology to assess the vulnerability of DNNs. Our approach involves freezing the weights of trained classification models and introducing a patch parameter that is strategically placed on images from diverse datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR-100, and a transportation dataset comprising 43 categories. The primary objective is to evaluate the impact of these patches on DNNsâ€™ classification accuracy, particularly focusing on their robustness against white-box and black-box attacks.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Data is readily available with the growing number of smart and IoT devices. However, application-specific data is available in small chunks and distributed across demographics. Also, sharing data online brings serious concerns and poses various security and privacy threats. To solve these issues, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising secure and collaborative learning solution.

However, FL is prone to poisoning and inference attacks in the presence of malicious participants and curious servers.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Financial institutions rely on data for many operations, including a need to drive efficiency, enhance services and prevent financial crime. Data sharing across an organisation or between institutions can facilitate rapid, evidence-based decision-making, including identifying money laundering and fraud. However, modern data privacy regulations impose restrictions on data sharing. For this reason, privacy-enhancing technologies are being increasingly employed to allow organisations to derive shared intelligence while ensuring regulatory compliance. This paper examines the case in which regulatory restrictions mean a party cannot share data on accounts of interest with another (internal or external) party to determine individuals that hold accounts in both datasets. The names of account holders may be recorded differently in each dataset. We introduce a novel privacy-preserving scheme for fuzzy name matching across institutions, employing fully homomorphic encryption over MinHash signatures. The efficiency of the proposed scheme is enhanced using a clustering mechanism. Our scheme ensures privacy by only revealing the possibility of a potential match to the querying party. The practicality and effectiveness are evaluated using different datasets, and compared against state-of-the-art schemes. It takes around 100 and 1000 seconds to search 1000 names from 10k and 100k names, respectively, meeting the requirements of financial institutions. Furthermore, it exhibits significant performance improvement in reducing communication overhead by 30-300 times.</p>

Data sharing across an organisation or between institutions can facilitate rapid, evidence-based decision making, including identifying money laundering and fraud. However, data privacy regulations impose restrictions on data sharing. Privacy-enhancing technologies are being increasingly employed to allow organisations to derive shared intelligence while ensuring regulatory compliance. This paper examines the case in which regulatory restrictions mean a party cannot share data on accounts of interest with another (internal or external) party to identify people that hold an account in each dataset. We observe that the names of account holders may be recorded differently in each data set. We introduce a novel privacy-preserving approach for fuzzy name matching â€¦</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Federated learning is a collaborative machine learning paradigm that brings the model to the edge for training over the participantsâ€™ local data under the orchestration of a trusted server. Though this paradigm protects data privacy, the aggregator has no control over the local data or model at the edge. So, malicious participants could perturb their locally held data or model to post an insidious update, degrading global model accuracy. Recent Byzantine-robust aggregation rules could defend against data poisoning attacks. Also, model poisoning attacks have become more ingenious and adaptive to the existing defenses. But these attacks are crafted against specific aggregation rules. This work presents a generic model poisoning attack framework named Sine (Similarity is not enough), which harnesses vulnerabilities in cosine similarity to increase the impact of poisoning attacks by 20â€“30%.

 <summary>Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning Framework using Permissioned Blockchain<br><b style="color:#32a87b;"></b><br><em style="color:blue;">Kasyap, Harsh</em>, Tripathy, Somanath</summary>
  <div>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Data is readily available with the growing number of smart and IoT devices. Industries of different sectors follow technological advancement to be benefited from data sharing. However, application-specific data is available in small chunks and distributed across demographics. Additionally, sharing data online brings serious concerns and poses various security and privacy threats. To address these issues, federated learning (FL), a secure and collaborative learning paradigm, would be suitable, which brings the machine learning model to the data owners. Unfortunately, FL is prone to poisoning and inference attacks in presence of malicious users and curious servers. This work proposes a permissioned blockchain based federated learning framework, called PrivateFL (Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning Framework). PrivateFL replaces the central server with a Hyperledger Fabric network, to prevent inference attacks. Further, we propose VPSA (Vertically Partitioned Secure Aggregation) tailored to PrivateFL framework, which performs robust and secure aggregation. PrivateFL facilitates multi-tenancy for learning different machine learning models. Theoretical analysis proves that the system is resistant against inference attacks, even if n-1 peers are compromised. A secure prediction mechanism is also proposed to securely query a global model and protecting its intellectual property rights. Experimental evaluation shows that PrivateFL performs better than the traditional (centralized) learning systems and converges faster, while capable enough to detect malicious updates.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Federated learning allows multiple participants to come together and collaboratively train an intelligent model. It allows local model training, while keeping the data in-place to preserve privacy. In contrast, deep learning models learn by observing the training data.

    abstract = "Federated learning allows multiple participants to come together and collaboratively train an intelligent model. It allows local model training, while keeping the data in-place to preserve privacy. In contrast, deep learning models learn by observing the training data. Consequently, local models produced by participants are not presumed to be secure and are susceptible to inference attacks. Existing inference attacks require training multiple shadow models, white-box knowledge of training models and auxiliary data preparation, which makes these attacks to be ineffective and infeasible. This paper proposes a model interpretation based label sniffing attack called MILSA, which does not interfere with learning of the main task but learns about the presence of a particular label in the target (participantâ€™s) training model. MILSA uses Shapley based value functions for interpreting the training models to frame inference â€¦",

The existing techniques, like static and dynamic analysis, fail to mitigate newly generated malware. Also, the signature, behavior, and anomaly-based defense mechanisms are susceptible to obfuscation and polymorphism attacks. With machine learning in practice, several authors proposed different classification and visualization techniques for malware detection. Images have proved worth analyzing the behavior of malware.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Clinical trials and drug discovery would not be effective without the collaboration of institutions. Earlier, it has been at the cost of individualâ€™s privacy. Several pacts and compliances have been enforced to avoid data breaches. The existing schemes collect the participantâ€™s data to a central repository for learning predictions as the collaboration is indispensable for research advances. The current COVID pandemic has put a question mark on our existing setup where the existing data repository has proved to be obsolete. There is a need for contemporary data collection, processing, and learning. The smartphones and devices held by the last person of the society have also made them a potential contributor. It demands to design a distributed and decentralized Collaborative Learning system that would make the knowledge inference from every data point.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Medical data held in silos by institutions, makes it challeng-ing to predict new trends and gain insights, as, sharing individual data leaks user privacy and is restricted by law. Meanwhile, the Federated Learning framework [11] would solve this problem by facilitating on-device training while preserving privacy. However, the presence of a central server has its inherent problems, including a single point of failure and trust. Moreover, data may be prone to inference attacks. This paper presents a Distributed Net algorithm called DNet to address these issues posing its own set of challenges in terms of high communication latency, performance, and efficiency. Four different networks have been discussed and compared for computation, latency, and precision. Empirical analysis has been performed over Chest X-ray Images and COVID-19 dataset. The theoretical analysis proves our claim that the algorithm has a lower communication latency and provides an upper bound.</p>
