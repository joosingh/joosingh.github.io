<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Bone infections are common complications of joint replacement surgeries. Standard antibiotic therapies often fail due to compromised blood supply and bacterial growth on prosthetics. Currently, localized antibiotic delivery is accomplished by antibiotic‚Äêloaded bone cements (ALBCs). However, ALBCs lack the required mechanical strength. To address these limitations, therapeutic gentamicin methacrylic comonomers (gMAs) are developed. These comonomers use a methacrylic carbonyl bond for hydrolytically controlled drug release, and actively contribute to poly (methyl methacrylate) cement curing, enhancing strength. Structure‚Äêproperty relationships evaluate mechanical properties of fresh and aged cements, release behavior, and antibacterial performance with respect to type of tether bond, and gMA loading percentage (3‚Äì10%). gMA‚Äêloaded cements match clinical strength, even at 10% loading, with ‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The wet environment in the oral cavity is challenging for topical disease management approaches. The compromised material properties leading to weak adhesion and short retention (&lt;8 h) in such environment result in frequent reapplication of the therapeutics. Composites of bacterial cellulose (BC) and carbene-based bioadhesives attempt to address these shortcomings. Previous designs comprised of aqueous formulations. The current design, for the first time, presents dry, shelf-stable cellulose patches for convenient ready-to-use application. The dry patches simultaneously remove tissue surface hydration while retaining carbene-based photocuring and offers on-demand adhesion. The dry patch prototypes are optimized by controlling BC/adhesive mole ratios and dehydration technique. The adhesion strength is higher than commercial denture adhesives on soft mucosal tissues. The structural integrity is ‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Bioadhesives comprising of catechol crosslinkers have displayed broad utility against both soft and hard substrates. However, catechol&#x27;s two-part adhesion chemistry requires oxidative chemicals that are detrimental to organic substrates.

 <summary>Design of bacterial cellulose adhesives for wet tissue adhesion in oral cavity<br><b style="color:#32a87b;"></b><br><em style="color:blue;">Singh, Juhi</em></summary>
  <div>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Wet and dynamic environment of the oral cavity poses challenges for topical disease management approaches. Conventional treatments for oral wounds and infections exhibit weak adhesion to wet surfaces which results in short retention duration (6-8 hours), frequent dosing requirement and patient incompliance. Mucoadhesive drug delivery platforms are proposed herein for oral wound sites with soft tissue adhesion capability and ability to retain structural integrity in wet environments. Bacterial cellulose (BC) and photoactivated carbene-based bioadhesives are combined to yield flexible film platforms for interfacing soft tissues in dynamic, wet environments. Three platforms are presented in this thesis that are (1) layered composites, (2) fibrillated BC and carbene bioadhesive based hydrogels and (3) integrated adhesive patches. The first platform consists of carbene bioadhesive layered onto dry BC matrix and is referred to as 2-component layered composite. Structure-activity relationships evaluate UVA dose and hydration state with respect to adhesive strength on soft tissue mimics. The layered composite has an adhesion strength ranging from 7-17 kPa and duration exceeding 48 hours in wet conditions under sustained shear forces, while other mucoadhesives based on hydrophilic macromolecules exhibit adhesion strength of 0.5-5 kPa and last only a few hours. The work highlights the first evaluation of BC composites for mucoadhesive treatments in the buccal cavity. The layered composites however exhibit fracture in the adhesive matrix owing to non-homogenous carbene bioadhesive layer. Moreover, the composites could not be ‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Topical approaches to oral diseases require frequent dosing due to limited retention time. A mucoadhesive drug delivery platform with extended soft tissue adhesion capability of up to 7 days is proposed for on-site management of oral wound.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Topical treatments for oral wounds and infections exhibit weak adhesion to wet surfaces which results in short retention duration (6‚Äì8 hours), frequent dosing requirement and patient incompatibility. To address these limitations, aqueous composites made of fibrillated bacterial cellulose and photoactive bioadhesives are designed for soft epithelial surfaces. The aqueous composites crosslink upon photocuring within a minute and exhibit a transition from viscous to elastic adhesive hydrogels. The light-cured composites have shear moduli mimicking oral mucosa and other soft tissues. The tunable adhesion strength ranges from 3 to 35 kPa on hydrated tissue-mimicking surfaces (collagen film). The results support the application of bacterial cellulose hydrogel systems for potential treatment of mucosal wounds.</p>

 <summary>Novel drug delivery systems and significance in respiratory diseases<br><b style="color:#32a87b;"></b><br>Mishra, Brahmeshwar, <em style="color:blue;">Singh, Juhi</em></summary>
  <div>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Pulmonary drug delivery offers targeted therapy for the treatment of respiratory diseases such as asthma, lung cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. However, this route poses challenges like deposition mechanism, drug instability, and rapid clearance mechanism. Other factors like the type of inhaler device, patient compatibility, consistent delivery by device, and inhaler technique also affect the performance of pulmonary delivery systems. Thus, to overcome these issues, pulmonary delivery systems utilizing particle-based approaches (nano/microparticles) have emerged in the last two decades. This chapter provides insight into various mechanisms of pulmonary drug administration, the ideal requirements of a pulmonary system, and the general devices used for pulmonary delivery. An overview of new pulmonary delivery systems and their relevance in the treatment of respiratory diseases is ‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Microbial infection and oxidative damage of the fibroblast often results in prolonged and incomplete wound healing. Therefore, there is an increasing demand for a scaffold being effective to prevent any possible infection and neutralize excessively released free radicals. Herein, we designed a PCL-based nanofiber loaded with ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (CHL) and quercetin. Developed nanofiber showed the formation of smooth and continuous nanofiber with 101.59 ¬± 29.18 nm average diameter and entrapping the drugs in amorphous form without any possible physico-chemical interaction between drugs and excipient. High entrapment efficiency (CHL: 92.04% and Que: 94.32%) and prolonged in-vitro release (for 7 days) demonstrated the capability of scaffold to suppress any probable infection and oxidative damage, which was further confirmed by in-vitro antibacterial and antioxidant activity.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Quercetin (Qu), is a flavonoid known to have anti-diabetic effects owing to its antioxidant property, thus promoting regeneration of the pancreatic islets, ultimately increasing insulin secretion. But the therapeutic application of Qu is hampered by its low oral bioavailability and its unfavourable physicochemical characteristics. The present work aimed at formulation of Quercetin loaded Soluplus¬Æ micelles (SMs) so as to enhance its bioavailability and provide prolonged release for the management of diabetes. Box-Behnken response surface methodology was employed to optimize the formulation prepared using co-solvent evaporation method. Physicochemical characterization confirmed the nano-spherical nature of Quercetin loaded Soluplus¬Æ micelles (Qu-SMs) with average particle size ranging from 85-108nm, encapsulation efficiency of 63-77%.

Chronic hyperglycemia may lead to over production of free radicals thereby results in oxidative stress which impaired healing of wounds. Ferulic acid (FA) has been shown to have antidiabetic and antioxidant properties. The aim of the present study was to develop Ferulic acid nanoparticles and to study its hypoglycemic and wound healing activities. Ferulic acid-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (FA-PLGA) nanoparticles were prepared by nano precipitation method. The prepared FA-PLGA nanoparticles had an average size of 240 nm. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis showed the prepared FA-PLGA nanoparticles were spherical in shape.
